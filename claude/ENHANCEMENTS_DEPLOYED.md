## 🧠 What the AI Now Understands

### The Four Blocks (Complete Framework)
```
Anger:
  - Formula: Injustice + "must not" belief → Anger
  - Root beliefs: World should be fair, people must behave as I expect
  - Cures: Accept fairness doesn't exist, prefer don't demand
  
Anxiety:
  - Formula: Potential danger + catastrophic thinking → Anxiety
  - Root beliefs: I must predict future, worry keeps me safe
  - Cures: Accept uncertainty, challenge catastrophic predictions
  
Depression:
  - Formula: Loss + worthlessness belief → Depression
  - Root beliefs: Self-worth depends on approval, past defines future
  - Cures: Build self-compassion, separate self from actions
  
Guilt:
  - Formula: Rule violation + identity attack → Guilt
  - Root beliefs: I must be perfect, I am fundamentally broken
  - Cures: Self-forgiveness, distinguish guilt from shame
```

### The ABCs
- **A (Activating Event)**: Objective reality
- **B (Belief)**: What you're telling yourself (WHERE EMOTION IS CREATED)
- **C (Consequence)**: How you feel and act (RESULT OF B, NOT A)

**Key insight**: Changing B changes C, not A!

### Seven Irrational Beliefs
1. Everyone must approve of me
2. I must be perfectly competent
3. People must be fair or deserve punishment
4. Things must go my way
5. My unhappiness is external
6. I must worry to stay safe
7. Avoidance is easier than facing things

### Techniques the AI Can Suggest
- Deep breathing & grounding
- Thought challenging process
- Mindfulness & observation
- Behavioral activation
- Self-compassion exercises
- Acceptance practices
- Exposure techniques
- Gratitude practices

### Conversation Approach
- Ask questions instead of giving answers
- Help people discover insights
- Normalize struggles
- Build self-compassion
- Offer concrete techniques
- Emphasize agency
- Reference the book
- Maintain warm tone
