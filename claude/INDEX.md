## 🎓 Code Structure

### Example: How a User Message Flows

```typescript
User types: "How do I stop getting angry?"
                    ↓
         Components/ChatInterface sends to API
                    ↓
         app/api/chat/route.ts receives
                    ↓
         OpenAI generates embedding of message
                    ↓
         lib/vectorSearch finds 5 similar book chunks
                    ↓
         lib/prompts builds system prompt with context
                    ↓
         lib/openai streams response back
                    ↓
         UI updates in real-time
                    ↓
      "Here's what the book says about Anger..."
