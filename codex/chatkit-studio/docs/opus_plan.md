## My 4 Blocks - ChatGPT App Improvement Plan

### Project Context

My 4 Blocks is an emotional wellness platform based on Dr. Vincent E. Parr's **"You Only Have Four Problems"** framework.

The project has two main implementations:
- **v0/** – Production Next.js website with custom chat interface
- **codex/chatkit-home/** – ChatKit widget integration

---

### Key Findings from OpenAI Documentation Analysis

After reviewing OpenAI's official ChatGPT Apps SDK documentation, I've identified several opportunities to improve alignment with best practices.

---

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Extract Atomic Actions from Current Implementation ⭐ **High Priority**

**Current State:**
- The main chat interface (`v0/`) provides general Four Blocks conversation.
- ChatKit integration (`codex/chatkit-home/`) offers suggested prompts but lacks focused tools.

**OpenAI Best Practice:**

> "Instead of mirroring your full website or native app, identify a few atomic actions that can be extracted as tools. Each tool should expose the minimum inputs and outputs needed for the model to take the next step confidently."

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Create focused MCP tools** for specific 4 Blocks workflows:
   - `identify_block` – Analyze user's situation to identify which block (Anger/Anxiety/Depression/Guilt)
   - `find_irrational_belief` – Extract the underlying irrational belief from user's narrative
   - `dispute_belief` – Apply REBT disputation questions (Ellis/Byron Katie)
   - `create_daily_plan` – Generate a 4 Blocks daily planning structure
   - `reflect_on_day` – End-of-day reflection using the 4 Blocks framework

2. Each tool should have:
   - Clear, action-oriented names (verb-based)
   - Explicit input parameters (user's situation, emotion, context)
   - Structured output (identified block, belief, disputation questions, etc.)
   - Proper annotations (`readOnlyHint` for analysis tools, no hints for planning tools)

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- New: `mcp-server/` directory with tool definitions
- New: `mcp-server/tools/identify-block.ts`
- New: `mcp-server/tools/find-belief.ts`
- New: `mcp-server/tools/dispute-belief.ts`
- Modify: `codex/chatkit-studio/widgets/four-blocks-planner.md` to align with tool structure

- New: `mcp-server/tools/dispute-belief.ts`
- Modify: `codex/chatkit-studio/widgets/four-blocks-planner.md` to align with tool structure

---

### 2. Improve Tool Descriptions for Better Model Selection ⭐ **High Priority**

**Current State**
- Suggested prompts exist but lack structured tool definitions
- No formal MCP server implementation

**OpenAI Best Practice**
> "Write action-oriented tool names and descriptions that include 'Use this when…' guidance, note disallowed/edge cases, and add parameter descriptions to help the model choose the right tool."

**Recommended Tool Description Format**
```js
{
  name: "identify_block",
  description: "Identify which of the 4 emotional blocks (Anger, Anxiety, Depression, Guilt) a user is experiencing based on their situation. Use this when the user describes an emotional challenge but hasn't yet identified the core emotion. Do not use for general conversation or when the block is already clear.",
  parameters: {
    situation: "Brief description of what happened (1-3 sentences)",
    feelings: "Words the user used to describe their emotions",
    thought_pattern: "What the user is telling themselves about the situation"
  }
}
```

**Files to Create**
- `mcp-server/schemas/tool-schemas.ts`
- `mcp-server/utils/tool-registry.ts`

---

### 3. Implement Conversational UI Patterns (Not Long-Form Content) ⭐ **Medium Priority**

**Current State**
- `/about` and `/book` pages contain long-form educational content
- Could overwhelm users in a conversational context

**OpenAI Best Practice**
> "Avoid displaying long-form or static content better suited for a website or app."

**Recommended Actions**
1. Convert long-form content into conversational, on-demand snippets
2. Use inline cards for bite-sized educational content
3. Implement "Show more" patterns for deeper dives
4. Move comprehensive documentation to external website, keep ChatGPT interface focused on active problem-solving

**Files to Create/Modify**
- New: `components/cards/concept-card.tsx` (for bite-sized Four Blocks concepts)
- New: `components/cards/belief-card.tsx` (for displaying identified beliefs)
- Modify: `app/about/page.tsx` → Convert to conversational FAQ format
- Modify: `app/book/page.tsx` → External link or shortened version

---

### 4. Add Display Modes for Better Presentation ⭐ **Medium Priority**

**Current State**
- Single chat interface without structured display modes
- ChatKit integration exists but doesn't leverage display modes

**OpenAI Best Practice**
ChatGPT Apps support three display modes:
- **Inline cards** - Quick confirmations, summaries
- **Fullscreen** - Rich interactive experiences
- **Picture-in-Picture** - Ongoing sessions (games, live activities)

**Recommended Display Mode Strategy**

**Inline Cards:**
- Belief identification summary card
- Daily 4 Blocks plan card
- Quick emotional check-in card

**Fullscreen:**
- Interactive belief disputation worksheet
- Daily reflection journal interface
- 4 Blocks progress tracker/dashboard

**Implementation Example:**
```jsx
// Example inline card component
export function BeliefCard({ belief, block, disputationQuestions }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <Badge>{block}</Badge>
        <CardTitle>Belief Identified</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p className="text-sm">{belief}</p>
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button onClick={openFullscreen}>Dispute This Belief</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

**Files to Create**
- `components/display-modes/inline-belief-card.tsx`
- `components/display-modes/fullscreen-disputation.tsx`
- `components/display-modes/daily-plan-card.tsx`

---

### 5. Use Apps SDK UI Design System ⭐ **Low Priority (but recommended)**

**Current State**
- Using Radix UI + Tailwind (good foundation!)
- Custom styling may not match ChatGPT's visual language

**OpenAI Recommendation**
> "Use the Apps SDK UI design system. It provides styling foundations with Tailwind, CSS variable design tokens, and a library of well-crafted, accessible components."

**Recommended Actions**
1. Install `@openai/apps-sdk-ui` package
2. Use OpenAI's Figma component library for design consistency
3. Replace custom components with SDK components where applicable
4. Maintain brand colors only on accents/badges (not backgrounds or text)

**Implementation**
```sh
pnpm add @openai/apps-sdk-ui
```

**Files to Modify**
- `v0/tailwind.config.js` - Import SDK design tokens
- `v0/styles/globals.css` - Use CSS variables from SDK
- `components/ui/` - Gradually migrate to SDK components

---

### 6. Optimize ChatKit Integration ⭐ **High Priority**

**Current State**
- ChatKit session endpoint exists (`codex/chatkit-home/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts`)
- Device ID tracking implemented
- Workflow ID configured

**Gaps**
- No session refresh logic
- Missing tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `openWorldHint`)
- No proper error handling for session expiration

**Recommended Actions**

1. **Implement Session Refresh:**
```js
// codex/chatkit-home/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { existingSecret } = await request.json();

  // If existing secret provided, refresh the session
  if (existingSecret) {
    const refreshedSession = await openai.chatkit.sessions.refresh({
      clientSecret: existingSecret
    });
    return Response.json({ client_secret: refreshedSession.client_secret });
  }

  // Otherwise create new session
  const session = await openai.chatkit.sessions.create({
    workflow: { id: process.env.CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID },
    user: deviceId
  });

  return Response.json({ client_secret: session.client_secret });
}
```

2. **Add Tool Annotations in Agent Builder:**
When defining tools in the workflow, ensure proper annotations:
- `identify_block` → `readOnlyHint: true` (analysis only)
- `find_irrational_belief` → `readOnlyHint: true` (analysis only)
- `dispute_belief` → `readOnlyHint: true` (provides questions, doesn't change state)
- `create_daily_plan` → no hints (creates new content, requires confirmation)
- `reflect_on_day` → no hints (writes reflection, requires confirmation)

**Files to Modify**
- `codex/chatkit-home/app/api/chatkit/session/route.ts`
- `codex/chatkit-home/app/page.tsx` (update client-side session handling)

---

### 7. Privacy & Data Minimization ⭐ **High Priority (Compliance)**

**Current State**
- No visible privacy policy
- Full conversation context may be sent to endpoints

**OpenAI Requirement**
> "Submissions must include a clear, published privacy policy explaining the categories of personal data collected, the purposes of use, the categories of recipients, and any controls offered to users."

**Recommended Actions**
1. Create privacy policy page
2. Implement data minimization:
   - Only send necessary context to tools (not full chat history)
   - Avoid requesting precise location data
   - No collection of sensitive data (PHI, government IDs, credentials)
3. Add privacy disclosure before first use

**Files to Create**
- `v0/app/privacy/page.tsx`
- `v0/components/privacy-disclosure-banner.tsx`
- Update: `README.md` with privacy practices section

---

### 8. Performance & Responsiveness ⭐ **Medium Priority**

**Current State**
- Streaming responses implemented ✅
- Edge runtime for chat API ✅

**OpenAI Best Practice**
> "Apps must be thoroughly tested to ensure stability, responsiveness, and low latency across a wide range of scenarios."

**Recommended Actions**
1. Add loading states for all tool calls
2. Implement retry logic for failed requests
3. Add timeout handling (max 30s for tool responses)
4. Show "thinking" indicators during processing

**Files to Modify**
- `v0/components/chat/chat-message.tsx` - Add loading states
- `v0/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Add timeout and retry logic
- `codex/chatkit-home/app/page.tsx` - Add error boundaries

---
