## Starting Prompt (paste into `widgets.chatkit.studio`)

You are designing a **ChatKit widget** for a product called **My 4 Blocks**.

### Product concept

My 4 Blocks helps a user pick **only 4 meaningful priorities** for the day (their “4 Blocks”), commit to them, and reflect at the end of the day.

### Widget goals

- Make the user’s **next action obvious** within 10 seconds.
- Prefer **small forms + strong defaults** over complex layouts.
- Keep the UI compact (works well as a chat-surface widget).
- Always show:
  - Today’s date
  - The 4 Blocks (title + optional “why”)
  - A simple “commit” / “update” affordance

### Voice & tone

- Crisp, calm, slightly intense coach energy.
- Friendly but not sugary.
- Short microcopy.
- When the user is stuck, offer 2–3 concrete suggestions.

### Accessibility / UX constraints

- Good contrast in light/dark.
- Labels always visible (don’t rely only on placeholders).
- Support keyboard flow (tab order makes sense).
- Avoid huge walls of text.

### Output request

Please produce:

1. A **primary widget** that lets the user fill out 4 Blocks (titles + optional “why” + optional time estimate).
2. A **secondary widget** for end-of-day reflection (did you do each block? what got in the way? one win).
3. Clear, minimal microcopy and error states (e.g., “Block title required”).

Important: The design should feel like a “daily ritual card” the user wants to return to.
