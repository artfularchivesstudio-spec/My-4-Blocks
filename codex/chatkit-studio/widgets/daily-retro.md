## Widget Spec — “Daily Retro”

### What this widget is for

End-of-day reflection on the 4 Blocks:

- Did you do them?
- What got in the way?
- What’s one win you’ll carry forward?

### Layout

- **Header**
  - Title: “Daily Retro”
  - Subtitle: “2 minutes. Honest answers.”
- **Body**
  - A compact checklist for Blocks 1–4:
    - Status: Done / Partial / Not done
    - Optional: one-line note (“why?”)
  - A short text area:
    - Label: “What got in the way?”
    - Helper: “Name the friction. Don’t moralize it.”
  - One-line input:
    - Label: “One win from today”
- **Footer**
  - Primary: “Save retro”
  - Secondary: “Plan tomorrow’s 4 Blocks”

### Microcopy

- Empty win hint: “Even a messy day has a win. Find it.”
- Save success: “Saved. Tomorrow starts lighter.”

### Behavioral constraints

- Don’t shame the user.
- If all blocks are “Not done”, suggest:
  - “Tomorrow: reduce Block scope by 50%.”
  - “Pick 1 ‘must win’ Block and 3 ‘bonus’ Blocks.”
