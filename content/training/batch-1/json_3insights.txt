    "title": "Core Questions About the Three Insights",
    "content": "The Three Insights explain why emotions arise, why they feel automatic, and why they persist even when you understand them logically. People ask why thoughts feel personal, why emotions feel real, and why changing thinking is difficult. The Three Insights reveal the mechanics behind experience: thoughts appear automatically, consciousness makes them feel real, and the mind identifies with them. Seeing these mechanics reduces emotional disturbance.",

    "content": "Thoughts arise on their own without your permission. The mind produces a constant stream of mental activity, including images, memories, predictions, and commentary. You do not choose your thoughts any more than you choose your heartbeat. Emotional disturbance begins when you believe you are the author of every thought.",

    "content": "Consciousness brings thoughts to life. When a thought appears, consciousness highlights it, making it feel vivid, important, or threatening. This is why intrusive thoughts feel real even when they are irrational. Consciousness does not judge thoughts; it simply illuminates them.",

    "content": "Emotions intensify when you identify with thoughts. When you believe 'this thought is me' or 'this thought means something about me,' the emotional consequence becomes stronger. Disturbance arises from identification, not from the thought itself. When you see thoughts as mental events rather than identity, emotional intensity decreases.",
