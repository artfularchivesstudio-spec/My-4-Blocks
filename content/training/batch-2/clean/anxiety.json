    "title": "Core Questions About Anxiety",
    "content": "Anxiety comes from demanding certainty about the future. People ask why anxiety feels automatic, why it spikes without warning, and why it persists even when nothing is wrong. Anxiety is created by the belief that something bad might happen and that you must be certain it won't. When the demand for certainty drops, anxiety decreases.",

    "title": "What Anxiety Is",
    "content": "Anxiety is the emotional result of demanding certainty about what will happen. It is not caused by danger itself but by the belief: 'Something bad might happen, and I must be sure it won't.' Anxiety is a prediction emotion, created by trying to control the future.",

    "title": "Why Anxiety Happens",
    "content": "Anxiety happens when the mind demands certainty in an uncertain world. The belief creates the emotion, not the situation. Anxiety signals that a 'what if' belief is active: 'What if something bad happens and I can't handle it?'",
