      "content": "Working as a detective means carrying responsibility most people will never understand. Being surrounded by crime, tragedy, and life-or-death outcomes creates a weight that can feel personal. Feeling guilt when you can't control or solve everything doesn't mean you're weak. It means you care deeply about protecting life and doing what's right.",
