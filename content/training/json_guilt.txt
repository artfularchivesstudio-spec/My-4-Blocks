    "title": "Core Questions About Guilt",
    "content": "Guilt comes from demanding that you should have behaved perfectly in the past. People ask why guilt lingers, why it resurfaces years later, and why it feels morally heavy. Guilt is created by the belief that you violated an internal rule and therefore deserve emotional punishment. When the demand for past perfection drops, guilt softens.",

    "content": "Guilt happens when the mind insists that you should have acted differently even though you could not have, given who you were and what you knew at the time. The belief creates the emotion, not the event. Guilt signals that a perfectionistic rule is active: 'I must not make mistakes.'",
