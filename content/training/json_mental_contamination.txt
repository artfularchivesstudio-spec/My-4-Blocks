    "title": "Core Questions About Mental Contamination",
    "content": "Mental contamination refers to the intrusive, sticky, looping thoughts that feel foreign, unwanted, or out of alignment with your values. People ask why these thoughts appear, why they feel so disturbing, and why they seem to repeat even when you try to push them away. Mental contamination is not a reflection of character or intention; it is a mechanical process of the mind misfiring and attaching meaning to noise.",

    "title": "What Mental Contamination Is",
    "content": "Mental contamination is the experience of feeling 'dirty,' 'wrong,' or 'tainted' by a thought, image, memory, or idea. It is not caused by the content itself but by the belief that the thought means something about you. The mind attaches moral weight to meaningless mental noise, creating distress.",

    "title": "Why Mental Contamination Matters",
    "content": "Mental contamination matters because it convinces people that their thoughts define them. This creates shame, fear, avoidance, and compulsive checking. The problem is not the thought but the interpretation: 'If I thought it, it must mean something about me.' Correcting the interpretation dissolves the contamination.",

    "title": "Narrator vs. Observer",
    "content": "Mental contamination becomes powerful when you confuse the narrator with the observer. The narrator is the automatic voice that produces thoughts without your permission. The observer is the part of you that notices the thoughts. Contamination occurs when you believe the narrator is you. Relief comes from recognizing that you are the observer, not the narrator.",

    "title": "Slow Explanation of Mental Contamination",
    "content": "Mental contamination is a misunderstanding of how thoughts work. The mind produces thousands of random thoughts daily. Some are pleasant, some neutral, some disturbing. When a disturbing thought appears, the mind sometimes attaches meaning to it, interpreting it as a reflection of character. This misinterpretation creates emotional contamination. When you see thoughts as random mental events, the contamination dissolves.",
