## 2026-01-30: 🎨 The Visual Awakening - Logos & UI Polish

Today, the digital sanctuary received its visual identity. We've incorporated the official logos and polished the interface to feel even more "magical" and unique.

### 🌟 Notes & Reflections
The addition of the logos anchors the experience. The main landing page now greets seekers with a large, glowing logo that drifts with the cosmic tide, while the chat interface maintains a professional yet ethereal header with the small logo. Fixing the "use client" build challenge reminded us that even in a magical realm, we must respect the boundaries of the digital canvas (Next.js App Router).

### ✅ What We Did
- **Visual Integration**: Moved `logo.webp` and `logo-small.webp` from `content/` to the public workshop.
- **UI Enhancement**: 
  - Added a glowing, animated main logo to the landing page (`page.tsx`).
  - Replaced the generic sparkles with the small logo in the `ChatInterface` header.
- **Build Calibration**: Resolved a Server Component vs. Client Component conflict by properly marking `page.tsx` as `'use client'`.
- **Global Deployment**: Redeployed the polished version to Vercel.

### 🏹 What Remains TODO
- [ ] Monitor the performance of the new visual elements.
- [ ] Consider adding more interactive animations to the logo on user engagement.

### 🚀 Timeline Reflections
- **04:23**: Logo extraction and workshop preparation.
- **04:24**: UI updates and build debugging.
- **04:25**: Successful Vercel redeployment with visual identity.

*The sanctuary now has a face. Wisdom and beauty in perfect harmony.* 🎭✨
