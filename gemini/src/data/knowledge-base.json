Wisdom is letting go of something every day.” ZEN PROVERB In my early years I studied with the world-famous clinical psychologist Dr. Albert Ellis, Ph.D., the creator of Rational Therapy (RT). He later changed RT to Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) and then Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), which is how we refer to it today. Albert Ellis is the grandfather of all the Rational therapies and the Cognitive Behavior Therapies (CBT) in use today. Dr. Ellis taught me how powerful individual words in our thinking can truly be. He taught me that the way an emotion is created can be broken down into a simple formula, and that there are three types of consequences: emotional, behavioral and physiological. It’s the beliefs we hold and tell ourselves over and over—about ourselves, about others, and about the",

I’ve observed 1) how consistently predictable they are, and 2) how we create these 1 Preface emotions in our minds by the way we think. All emotional and psychological suffering is conceived by four specific thinking habits or thought loops we get trapped in, repeating them over and over in our minds until we are nearly drowning in Anger, Anxiety, Depression and/or Guilt.

I capitalize these four words throughout this book because they are more than just negative emotions—they are the four most critical blocks to happiness and contentment in life. Rarely do we have just one or two of these stumbling blocks; everyone has, at some point, encountered all four of these emotional obstacles to our contentment in life. In addition, we all have what I call our personal ‘racket,’ which is defined as our favorite bad feeling. It is not your favorite because you love it so much, but when you upset yourself, it is the one you choose most often.

We have always been and always will be interdependent and interconnected across all varieties of the human family. 2 Preface These are just a few of the things your therapist doesn’t tell you, unless you have a Rational therapist or, even better, a Mindfulness (or Zen) based Rational therapist.

The wordiness has been stripped to a bare min imum to keep the message as direct and accessible as possible.

Yet most of us would agree, if we thought about it, that arguing with reality is a total waste of our precious time!

Yet we waste countless hours of our finite lives debating whether things are fair, whose fault it is that they are the way they are, and why it should be this way and not that way! We create and carry with us the perpetual notion that we have piles upon piles of problems, large and small, trivial and critical, temporary and permanent. The truth is that you only have four problems at the root of all your suffering; four devastating emotions you create from your fixed false beliefs, opinions, and ideas about reality and truth.

It is a guide to not only relieving the emotional disturbances caused by these four blocks, but about how to replace them with what the Buddhists refer to as The Four Immeasurables: 1) loving kindness—active goodwill towards all, 2) compassion toward others and the self, 3) sympathetic & empathetic joy, and 4) equanimity, or even-mindedness and serenity.

It is, however, often oversimplified to the point of being thoroughly ineffective in a practical sense. The actual process of letting go, of routing out these long-held ideas and beliefs is much more complex. The ideas presented here go back to the ancient Greek and Roman stoics and skeptics as well as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Confucius, Taoist and Buddhist cultures and philosophy.

As George Carlin said when listening to a guest speaker, “Well, they have a great education, they went to all the great schools, they seem very smart. Aha, they are full of shit!” Ignorance is simply a lack of knowledge, learning, or information. My goal is to help alleviate this ignorance by challenging the ideas and beliefs you hold.

Delusion dooms us to disagree and fight over petty concerns, and to argue over whose beliefs are right—as if we will ever come to a rational compassionate solution under these circumstances. Throughout the course of human history, most human suffering has been the result of beliefs. This is the world of conflict. Not just between ourselves and our loved ones but with and between nations.

The Negative Feedback Superhighway There are three reasons why you are the way you are right now. Number one is genetic predisposition. We are predisposed to think, feel, and react in certain ways. Millions of years of natural selection led to your parents creating you, and with that you became predisposed to all sorts of tendencies like Anxiety, Depression and so on. 9 Mental Contamination Number two is environmental conditioning.

Number three is self-conditioning; that is, the way you talk to yourself, the story in your head. The Buddhists call it the monkey mind.

Mankind has landed on the moon, invented self-driving cars (well, almost), and developed computers small enough to fit in the palm of our hand, yet many of us do not have the tools to cultivate an undisturbed mind.

These patterns can play out in a negative feedback loop, a never-ending cycle of distressing thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiological effects. Our self-created conceptions inspire painful emotions that lead to undesirable actions. We then create more conceptions about our negative actions and those actions get our adrenaline pumping. Now we’re thinking more negative thoughts and the loop begins again. The effects of your inner dialogue on your emotions and behavior are almost immeasurable!

There are no negative emotions without irrational beliefs. What makes a belief rational vs. irrational? A rational belief is a preference. A belief that, although you might like a differ ent outcome, you accept reality as it is, just as Jim did after his argument with Dave.

Once you identify which irrational beliefs are causing your disturbance, you can dispute those thoughts, but it will be far more difficult if you don’t replace them with something more rational.

Can I stand it, even if I don’t like it?” “Does this situation make me or other people bad, horrible, and worthless?” “Will it truly never end or change?” This last step is critical.

Hold your beliefs—if any—very lightly with a cupped hand instead of a clenched fist, and always be willing to let go of it in an instant when new evidence emerges to refute it. One of the major reasons I love Zen so much is that it encourages us to have (i.e., hold) no beliefs! This is ultimate freedom. Nothing is holding us back. We do not have to consult some sacred standard or book to see if we are doing ‘right.’ Let’s now look back at those seven irrational beliefs and explore how to prove that they are irrational by disputing them. 1: ‘It’ Statements An ‘It’ statement starts with the idea that something or someone beside yourself is responsible for your emotions. “He, she, it, that, they, or you upset me.” It can also be a positive: “You make me happy.” This kind of thinking",

When you begin to pay attention to your inner dialog, you’ll notice much of your disturbance begins with blaming something or someone for creating a painful, inconvenient, or undesirable 40 The Seven Irrational Beliefs feeling.

You are telling yourself something outside of you—your computer, that driver, your children—has the power to force you to respond angrily! We cannot be upset by the outside world. We can only be upset by our conceptions—our thoughts, feelings and beliefs—about it.

A familiar example of cause and effect is how gravity works here on Earth. Gravity results in objects falling. Making things fall—all objects, according to the same rules, every single time—is a function of gravity. It is measurable, provable, and predictable; g = 32 feet per second, squared. Does an object fall faster or slower at your house than it does at mine? I didn’t think so. Same for you, same for me.

But you might think, “Well, I felt the Anger when the tire went flat, so if the flat tire isn’t causing my Anger, then what is?” The answer is simple—it is your conception of what a flat tire means that’s causing Anger. You’ve told yourself a story: that a flat tire means dirtying your clothes, waiting on a tow truck, arriving late to work, and maybe getting yelled at by the boss. But these things are not reality!

Now, the dictionary defines awful as simply unpleasant, but the way Ellis used it—as the basis for ‘awfulizing’—is closer to what we may call ‘catastrophizing.’ In this sense, indicating the thought that something is not just unpleasant, but so much worse than unpleasant that it can’t be measured.

It’s certainly not going to make you feel any better! There are three ways to dispute Awfulizing. You don’t need all three, one should be enough, but in case one doesn’t work for you have options. OPTION 1: AWFUL AS AN ATTRIBUTE We often use awful as an attribute. That is, when we ascribe an inherent characteristic to something else that doesn’t actually possess it. It’s subjective—an opinion. There is nothing that inherently possesses awful, so this is automatically false.

This is because awful doesn’t actually exist in the painting—it is something that exists in the mind! Calling something awful is attributing a characteristic to it that it in itself doesn’t possess.

Zero percent would mean that nothing was unpleasant and 100% would be the worst thing that could ever happen to you or others in this lifetime. On a scale of 0% to 100%, where would having an itch that you couldn’t quite reach fall? How about getting a speeding ticket? How about being tortured to death? Some people react to a spot on their shirt or blouse as if it were a first strike nuclear attack! There is a variation in our experiences in life and we will have them all up and down this spectrum.

Perhaps you would say that losing a loved one is very close 46 The Seven Irrational Beliefs to 100% on your scale. But what if you lost 2 loved ones? That would be worse, right? What if the plane crashed going to the Parr family reunion? Surely that would be awful—right? No, it could still always be worse! So nothing can be entirely awful because things could always be worse. Thus, looking at things on a scale of unpleasantness disputes the idea that something can be entirely awful. When we use ‘awful’ to describe our belief about a situation we don’t like, we are saying it isn’t even on a scale of unpleasantness. It’s off the scale! It’s 110% or 400%",

But someone in my audience correctly pointed out that something could always be worse than this. When I asked, “Well, what could be worse?” he said, “That you could be tortured to death slower!” And he was correct! Something could always be worse.

For example, “I can take 69% unpleasantness, but 70% is too horrible and it Should not be!” But 70% unpleasantness has always existed and always will (at least in our mind!).

If a steamroller rolls over you slowly in first gear, you stand it to the point of death!” Big Al always did have a way with words! 4: Shoulds, Musts, Demands (SMDs) The fourth irrational belief is that a person, situation, or thing should be different than it is because we don’t like it: “It should be this way, not that way.” SMD’s (Shoulds, Musts & Demands) are the underlying irrational beliefs behind every negative emotion. You can’t feel bad without a Should, must or demand! 51 The Seven Irrational Beliefs Dr. Albert Ellis used to say: “When you are upset— cherche la Should (look for the Should).” This is what happens when our preferences become demands. What you would like reality to be becomes what you believe reality ought to be. In essence we have two philosophies toward life: a ‘desiring philosophy’ which is sane and rational, and a ‘demanding philosophy’ which is crazy and self-defeating. SMDs are the latter.

You can throw away your Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV, V, VI, and all later additions, forget all the labeling and rating of your friends, patients, and yourself, and look for one of all three of these ways of distorted thinking: 1: “ I should be perfectly competent, adequate, achieving, and successful in all",

This leads us to the only Rational should: “Everything that happens today should happen!” The key word in this sentence is ‘happens,’ not ‘should.’ If it happens, then it must exist. Since something does exist, it should exist because all the conditions occurred for it to do so. Everything that happens is the result of past events that created current conditions.

It exists because all the necessary conditions to create a traffic jam have already occurred and are still occurring—a lot of cars on the road, roads that are not wide enough, everyone getting out of work at the same time, etc. How could you have clear sailing under these conditions?

Once you have become aware of your irrational, demanding philosophy (SMDs) you can replace it with a rational, desiring philosophy. Some desiring or preference words to replace your demanding words are: • It would be better… • I would like… • I would prefer... • It would be nice… • We could… Let’s put these desiring words into our three examples from before. If we replace these with a rational, desiring philosophy toward life, these statements become: 1: “ It would be better if I were more competent, adequate, achieving, and successful in most ways!” You are accepting what is true and making a rational, provable statement about what would be better for you. 2: “ I would like you",

As a bonus, we usually feel better too! 55 The Seven Irrational Beliefs Do you see how much softer and more pleasant these words sound when compared to demands? A Should can be replaced with ‘I would prefer,’ or ‘it would be better.’ This we can prove or disprove. This is what makes it rational and scientific.

Bad, by definition, can contain no good or it wouldn’t be bad, and good can contain no bad or it wouldn’t be good.

The same goes for physical appearance. I feel so sorry for the young girls that grow up in our society today.

All it takes is one day of checking things off your to-do list to prove you are not, by definition, lazy. Our varsity football player can dispute self-rating that his failure to earn a first-string position means he is a failure and a bad person. If he were to apply rational thinking, he might say to himself, “I don’t like failing, but ‘I,’ my essence,",

It is certainly not true of our circumstances for three main reasons we’ve already discussed; 1: Events only happen as a result of a specific set of conditions. 2: Our emotions are created by our beliefs about events not the events themselves. 3: We are an ever-changing system, never the same at any two moments in time.
